# mini-message-board

This is a message board that lets users view past messages or post new ones. This project was meant as practice for using a templating language (Pug) with Express.

The live version of this project can be found here: [https://mini-message-board-production-d1ab.up.railway.app/](https://mini-message-board-production-d1ab.up.railway.app/)

## Lessons Learned

- Generating an app template with Express Application Generator.
- Creating HTML templates with Pug to use as views.
- Deploying a Node.js app through a PaaS. For this project, I used the free tier from [Railway](https://railway.app/).

## Disclaimer

This project is deployed on a platform with limited free hosting so it's possible that the link is no longer live by the time you're accessing it. Also, messages posted on the messaging board are not attributable to me other than the first few sample ones!
